Actions to be Taken
Handle Skewed Distributions:

Transformation: Apply transformations like log or square root to normalize highly skewed features.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or bins to handle extreme values and better represent the majority of data.
Address High Variability:

Outlier Treatment: Consider methods to handle outliers, such as capping or removing extreme values, especially for features with high variability.
Feature Scaling: Apply scaling techniques to standardize features and improve model performance.
Manage Target Imbalance:

Resampling Techniques: Use oversampling (e.g., SMOTE) or undersampling methods to balance the target variable.
Algorithmic Adjustments: Use algorithms that are robust to class imbalance or adjust class weights to improve performance on minority class.
Feature Engineering:

Create New Features: Derive new features or aggregate existing ones to better capture customer behaviors.
Interaction Terms: Explore interactions between features to uncover relationships affecting the target variable.

1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - **Imputation**: 
     - For numerical features (e.g., `MONTANT`, `REVENUE`), consider imputation methods like mean, median, or using predictive models.
     - For categorical features (e.g., `REGION`, `TOP_PACK`), use the mode or a separate category for missing values.
   - **Removal**: If a feature has too many missing values (e.g., `ZONE1`, `ZONE2`), consider dropping it if itâ€™s not crucial.

2. **Data Type Conversion**:
   - **Convert `TENURE`** and **`MRG`** to numeric types if they represent numeric values (e.g., if `TENURE` should be numeric but is currently an object).
   - **Categorical Encoding**: Convert categorical variables (e.g., `REGION`, `TOP_PACK`) to numeric using encoding techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - **Assess Missing Data Patterns**: Visualize missing data patterns to understand if the missingness is random or systematic.
   - **Data Quality Check**: Ensure that data types are consistent with their descriptions and values are within expected ranges.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **Create Flags for Missing Data**: Add binary features indicating whether a value was missing for certain columns.
   - **Aggregate Features**: Aggregate or combine features where appropriate to create more informative variables.

5. **Prepare Data for Modeling**:
   - **Feature Scaling**: Apply scaling to numerical features to standardize ranges.
   - **Handling Imbalance**: Since `CHURN` is imbalanced, use techniques like oversampling/undersampling or algorithms that handle imbalance.
