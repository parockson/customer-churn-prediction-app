# customer-churn-prediction-app

This challenge is for an African telecommunications company that provides customers with airtime and mobile data bundles. The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of each customer “churning,” i.e. becoming inactive and not making any transactions for 90 days.

This solution will help this telecom company to better serve their customers by understanding which customers are at risk of leaving.
